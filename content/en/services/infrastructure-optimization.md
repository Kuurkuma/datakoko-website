## Overview

Paying too much for your data infrastructure? We analyze your current setup and implement strategic optimizations that can reduce costs by 40-70% while maintaining or improving performance.

## Our Approach

### Infrastructure Audit
- Complete cost analysis of current setup
- Performance and utilization metrics review
- Bottleneck identification
- Right-sizing recommendations

### Optimization Strategy
- Resource optimization (CPU, memory, storage)
- Query and database performance tuning
- Caching layer implementation
- Data lifecycle management

### Migration & Implementation
- Gradual migration to optimized setup
- Zero-downtime transitions
- Performance monitoring
- Cost tracking and reporting

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Continuous cost optimization
- Performance tracking
- Capacity planning
- Regular optimization reviews

## Common Optimizations

- **Storage Tiering**: Move cold data to cheaper storage
- **Compute Right-Sizing**: Match resources to actual needs
- **Query Optimization**: Improve slow queries by 10-100x
- **Caching**: Reduce database load and costs
- **Compression**: Reduce storage and transfer costs
- **Scheduling**: Run heavy jobs during off-peak hours

## Case Study Results

- 65% reduction in cloud infrastructure costs
- 3x improvement in query performance
- 80% reduction in storage costs through compression
- Complete migration completed in 6 weeks

## Ideal For

- Companies with growing cloud bills
- Organizations with underutilized resources
- Teams experiencing performance issues
- Businesses wanting infrastructure transparency

## Outcome

A lean, efficient infrastructure that delivers better performance at a fraction of the cost, with clear visibility into where every dollar goes.
