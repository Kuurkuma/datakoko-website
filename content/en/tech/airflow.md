Apache Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. We use it to orchestrate complex data pipelines and ensure reliable data processing.

## Why We Use It

- **Python-Based**: Define workflows as code using Python
- **Scheduling**: Robust scheduling with cron-like expressions
- **Monitoring**: Rich UI for monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Extensible**: Hundreds of operators for different systems
- **Scalability**: Can scale from single machine to clusters

## Use Cases

- ETL/ELT pipeline orchestration
- Data warehouse refresh scheduling
- Multi-step data processing workflows
- Task dependency management
